Follow these steps to form a database which consists of relevant features such as name, position, department etc of analyst 1 and 2.

1. Open a new terminal and write 
	$psql
2. Previous step will open posgresql command line. Now copy and paste this command to form a new database 
	CREATE TABLE RATINGS(
	C_ID INT NOT NULL,
	A1_LOCATION VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A1_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A1_POS VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A1_DEPT VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A2_LOCATION VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A2_NAME VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A2_POS VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	A2_DEPT VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
	RATINGS_DATE DATE
	A1_ADD VARCHAR(50)
	A2_ADD VARCHAR(50)
	A1_AUX VARCHAR(50)
	A2_AUX VARCHAR(50));
	
  Now your database is ready to be filled with data. 
  
3. Open a new terminal and write

	$cd /home/finance/reports2sql
	$python executor.py
	
   The second command will execute a python file that will fill the database with relevant features of each report row-wise.

4. Now we need to clean our database. So we change full name of analyst to "first name and last name". Finally if
   a1_pos="Senior VP", we change it to a1_pos="Senior Vice President" and if a1_pos="SVP- Senior Credit Officer", then we update 
   it to a1_pos="Senior Vice President" and a1_aux="Senior Credit Officer"
   	
   	$python name_fetch.py
   	$python refiner.py
   	$python pos_fetch.py
   	$python final_refiner.py
   	
5. Now database is cleaned up and is ready for analysis.


For analysis, we need to connect MATLAB to the database and do the analysis. 
Following are the steps helpful in connecting MATLAB to the postgresql database.

1. Ensure that the MATLAB is closed. Run prefdir command on the command-line.
1. Create a new file javaclasspath.txt and add the destination of JDBC driver 
2. Now restart MATLAB write this command

	conn=database('finance','finance','iof2014','org.postgresql.Driver','jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/finance');
	a=isconnection(conn)
   if a is 1, then you are connected else you did a mistake. For further reference see this

IMPORTANT THINGS:
----------------
1. Changin first name and second name to new columns
2. Include capability for names with additional designation in name_fetch.py
2. see analyst_name.py file
3. See for full names having additional designations like CFA, CPA, Dr.
4. Adding future oriention, negative positive to our database 
5. Look at the outliers, methodology changes 
6. Merge same names for eg. A.J. Sabatelle and Angelo Sabatelle
7. Instead of database connection, read data from csv file
8. send analyst_names.csv file
